## 📊 Real-time Performance Monitoring

### Prometheus & Grafana Setup

We use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor real-time I/O performance during AOSP compilation across different storage configurations.

**Grafana Dashboard**: We use dashboard ID **11173** for comprehensive disk I/O monitoring.

#### Key Metrics Monitored:
- **Disk I/O Utilization** - Per-device read/write throughput
- **IOPS** - Input/Output operations per second for each storage device
- **I/O Queue Depth** - Outstanding I/O requests
- **Latency Metrics** - Read/write response times
- **CPU & Memory Usage** - System resource utilization during builds
- **Per-Process I/O** - Track I/O usage by AOSP build processes

#### Quick Setup:
```bash
# Install Prometheus node exporter
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/latest/download/node_exporter-*.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvf node_exporter-*.tar.gz
sudo cp node_exporter-*/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/

# Start node exporter
sudo systemctl start node_exporter

# Import Grafana dashboard
# In Grafana: Import → Dashboard ID: 11173
```

#### Dashboard Features:
- Real-time disk throughput graphs
- Historical performance comparison
- Alert thresholds for I/O bottlenecks
- Multi-disk comparison views
- AOSP build phase correlation

This monitoring setup helps identify:
- Which storage device becomes the bottleneck during compilation
- Peak I/O periods during AOSP builds
- Performance differences between ext4 and XFS in real-time
- Impact of noatime optimization on I/O patterns

## 📈 Benchmark Methodology

Our testing uses industry-standard `fio` benchmarks with:
- 1GB test files
- Direct I/O to bypass caching
- Multiple queue depths (1, 8, 32)
- Various block sizes (4K for random, 1M for sequential)

## 📝 Best Practices

### For CI/CD Environments
- Use NVMe for source code and build outputs
- Configure RAID arrays for artifact storage
- Implement build caching on fastest available storage

### For Local Development
- Mount `/tmp` on NVMe with noatime
- Use separate partitions for source and output
- Regular TRIM operations for sustained performance

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always backup data before applying optimizations
- Test optimizations in non-production environments first
- Monitor storage health with S.M.A.R.T. tools
- Consider wear leveling for SSD longevity
